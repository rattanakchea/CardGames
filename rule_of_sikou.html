    ++ Goal of the game
    The first person who gets rid of cards in their hands is the Winner.
    And collect a poll of money from other players.


    1. Determine how many players

    2. Each player get 5 cards, and the dealer get 6 cards

    - We keep the remaining deck of cards in the middle of the table

    - Get rids of the pairs in each hand
        + If the dealer has 3 pairs, dealer automatically becomes the winner
        + players can get rid of at most 2 pairs, and have 1 remain because they have odd number of cards.

    - After getting rid of pairs, dealer can rid of ONE card in their hand, and place it in front of her

    - Finding matched card:
        + In a clockwise circle, the next player check if they have the matched card thrown by the dealer
        + If found, they can get rid of the matched card, and throw an additional card away
        + If not found, it is repeated to the next player

        6a. If no one has a matched card, one card is removed from the remaining stack, and place in front of
        the next player position


    -  The game continues until the stacks is empty, in which case, the stack starts over

    -  The games then continue from Step 6a.
